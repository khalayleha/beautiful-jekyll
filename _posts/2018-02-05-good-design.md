### An Example of Good Design: _Sawyer Library_

Some students will say that the new Sawyer Library was a sight for sore eyes after working in the terrible excuse of a library Williams had before. But this new library not only beautiful, but also functional. Looking from the east side (see photo above), you'll notice a cascade of windows all the way down the building. The reason for this, besides providing students with a lovely view of the moutnains while studying, is that it floods the library with light, which would explain why the bookshelves are lined perpendicular to the windows. This greatly reduces the need for any lights during the day, thereby saving a great deal of energy. Compared to the old Sawyer, which was essentially a giant cube with tiny windows for light, this new library is an excellent example of well-thought design that is not only functional, but aesthetically pleasing.
