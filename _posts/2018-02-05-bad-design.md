## An Example of Bad Design: _Williams Course Catalog_

The course catalog was only recently upgraded to this new _chic_ design, and has already received countless complaints from the students. While, yes, it is aesthetically pleasing, and, yes, it's not that hard to use, it's a pain-in-the-neck to use. Rather than have a simple, easy to read, callapsable tab or window of some sort, they resort to this rabbit-hole-style journey that is honestly a pain when you're trying to look through courses. First you choose the division, then the major, then whether you're looking for Spring or Fall courses, each time loading a completely new webpage. After finding a course, you then have to go back up the rabbit-hole only to go back down another for another course you want to find. Your only other option is to contsantly open new tabs, clogging up precious toolbar space. Again, looks elegant, but not practical.
